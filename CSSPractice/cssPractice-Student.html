        <p>LANGLEY, VA&mdash;A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

        <p>According to the report, sections of the document&mdash; "almost invariably the most crucial passages" &mdash;are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

        <p><strong>CIA Director Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Cold War</li>
            <li>The Civil Rights Movement</li>
            <li>The Growth of the International Drug Trade</li>
        </ul>
